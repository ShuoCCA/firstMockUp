1.I want to output the value of the pressure sensor.


2.When I touch the pressure sensor, a small led lights.


3.I want to use the 4 digital 7 segment to show the value of presssure. I think it's a big challenge for me, it's so complicated.
I tested the pressure sensor, and I found its numerical range is between three and four digits, so I want to show the value )


4.I want to achieve arduino and processing communication. I want to Visualize the data  with processing
I tested it on processing, and I found I made some mistake which I can't solve it. why my value of arduino can not transfer to processing?


If I have enough time, I want to try useing the IR sensor, temperature and others connect it with arduino,and visualize the data.
